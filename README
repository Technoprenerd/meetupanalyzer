Meetup Analyzer is an analyzer that guesses the likelyhood of users going to other events from that same meetup.


Number of events from past 6 months, time = -6m,-1w
Get event rsvps from all events.
Add number of YES of each member.
If N yes >= percentage number, over all meetups.
Then there is a chance that that person will attend another meetup from that group.

Easy :)
